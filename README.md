# git-fit: Workout Tracker Command Line Interface

![License Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange)

## Description

A web-based shell command line interface for tracking workout sessions. Check out the site [here.](https://www.gitfit.me)

### Technology used

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- Security: NextAuth.js, OAuth2, Google reCAPTCHA v3
- Infrastructure and Deployment: Docker, AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM, SSM), Vercel, Supabase, Nginx

### Motivation

As a gym-goer and programmer, I wanted to create a workout entry logger specifically for myself and
fellow programmers. In order to access this logger at the gym, I decided to make this CLI web-based,
usable on desktops and mobile devices.

### In progress

- Frontend:
  - Fix hiding keyboard for mobile devices
  - Fix `pre` and `span` tags for mobile devices
  - Allow users to customize color scheme of shell
  - Create command for outputting graph of year of logs
  - Allow user to customize color theme for shell
- Backend:
  - Delete users after a year of inactiviy
  - Limit number of logs a user can add per day
  - Refactor SQLAlchemy to use SQLModel (better integrates to FastAPI, as it is built on top of SQLAlchemy)
- Docker: Push image to DockerHub
- CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions

## Running the application for development

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- Create the `.env` files as instructed in the `backend` and `frontend` directories

### Steps

1. Start the containers:

```sh
docker compose --profile dev up --build
```

2. Access the applications locally:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

3. Testing the application:

- Add/modify tests at `./backend/tests/` or `./frontend/tests/`
- Get the docker container ID of the running backend or frontend container:

```sh
docker ps
```

- Enter in the running backend or frontend container id:

```sh
docker exec -it <be_or_fe_container_id> /bin/bash
```

- Run the unit tests within the bash shell:

Backend:

```sh
pytest ./tests/
```

Frontend:

```sh
npm test
```

4. Stop the containers when finished:

```sh
docker-compose --profile dev down
```

## `fit` CLI

`fit`, inspired by `git` version control, helps keep track of your workout/exercise entries in a
command line interface. In other words, it is the _git_ for _workouts_, hence the name.

`fit reset --delete <YYYY-MM-DD>`

- Deletes all the workout commits on the specified day at **YYYY-MM-DD**

`fit log`

- Show commits of workout entries
- Include the `--year-month <YYYY-MM>` option to display logs of a specified month

`fit log --oneline`

- Shows commits of workout entries in compacted format
- Add the `--year-month <YYYY-MM>` option to display logs of a specified month

`fit log --week`
